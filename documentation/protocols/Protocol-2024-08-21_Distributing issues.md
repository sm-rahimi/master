# Protocol - Distributing Issues

Present: Alexander, Mostafa, Michael

## Review

Milestone 3a) was skipped because of the exam period.

What has been done so far?

Milestone 3a)
- Upload initial schedule (in progress - Mostafa)
- Create courses (done)
- Define Lecture and Exam Periods (done)
- Assign colors (in progress - Alexander)

Milestone 3b)
- Auto save calendar (postponed)
- Record changes & undo changes (done)
- Go to date (done)
- Filter (postponed)

## Implementation

CRUD for studyplans, modules, periods, lecturers, and rooms is very similar and is implemented in one dialog.

## Impediments

Uploading may be an issue, as there is very much data. Possible solutions:
- Open a dialog to be able to select desired objects.
- Load data dynamically.

## Distributing Issues

Some issues are related to each other. We formed issue groups and assigned the groups to team members.
- Upload (Mostafa)
- Download (Mostafa)
- CRUD (Michael)
- Filter (Michael)
- Conflict analysis (Michael)
- Pipeline (Alexander)
- Colours (Alexander)
- Saving locally (Alexander)

## Next Steps

Michael will contact Prof. Bockisch for a meeting on Thursday August 29th 15:00 o'clock.
