# Protocol - SCRUM meetings

Present: Alexander, Mostafa, Michael

## Sprint Review

The minimal viable product has been accepted by the product owner.

Issues with label `status::in review` should be reviewed by all before moving them to `status::acceptance`. Approving or disapproving can be done with thumbs up or down.

## Sprint Retrospective

What was good?
- The library `react-big-calendar`
- Prof. Bockisch agrees to use it although it uses yarn and JavaScript.
- perplexity.ai and chatgpt.com are a great help in programming.
- We only needed half of the time estimated.

What can be improved?
- SCRUM: 
	- Impediment list
	- Definition of Done (Feature implemented and manually tested.)
	- User Storys (Pattern: As a <role> I need <feature> so that <action>.)
	- Planning Poker (Michael wants to make cards)
	- Daily SCRUM (We want to meet on Mondays 10:15, regularly.)
- Roles Product Owner and SCRUM Master (will stay the same for the next sprint, but we may switch it later.)

## Impediments
- Exam period is about to begin. Next milestone is in exam period.


## Sprint planning

- Use full potential of `react-big-calendar`. Examine properties.
- Story points for next issues have been assigned.
- We have been assigned to issues.
- Basically we want to implement all assigned to the milestone 3a).
- Issues may be added.
