# Protocol - Preparation-Meeting

Present: Alexander, Mostafa, Michael

## Organizational
Change: Alexander will be Product Owner instead of Mostafa

## Technical matters
As an alternative for Material UI we could use Redux (Statemanagement), NextJS, ReactRouter, Tailwind CSS or just plain CSS.

## „Minimal Viable Product“:
Change: „Replication of events“ not to be implemented. Thus to be implemented:
- Implement calendar view
- Implement drag and drop of events
- Download schedule
- Upload schedule	

## Done:
- Minimum viable product has been chosen.
- Requirements have been worked out.
## Todo:
- Talk to Prof. Bockisch today.
